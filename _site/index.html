      <h1>Everyone dies.</h1>

      <h2>So will I, here is my will</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Is it strange to have a webpage on the internet with your wishes after your death?
        I think so, but I now that it can be very handy if the people around you don't agree on the way
        your funeral will be or how your belongings will be distributed.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Cremation or burial?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Cremation. Your can flush my ashes in the toilet or place them somewhere nice, I don't care.
        Baking a cake with it will be super awesome of course.</p>

        <p>The funny thing with cremations is that you still need a coffin.
        Please buy the cheapest one or build one yourself if you like that more.</p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <section>
        <p>I like <em>Seasons in the Sun</em> of <em>Terry Jecks</em> at the moment,
        it will probably change later. What I like about it is the happiness, please remember the fun times
        and forget the bad ones ;-)</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Belongings</h2>
      <section>
        <p>I probably won't have money when I'm dead. So be careful.</p>
      </section>
