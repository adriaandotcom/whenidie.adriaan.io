      <h1>Everyone dies.</h1>

      <h2>So will I, here is my will</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Is it strange to have a webpage on the internet with your wishes after your death?
        I think so, but I now that it can be very handy if the people around you don't agree on the way
        your funeral will be or how your belongings will be distributed.</p>

        <p>I give my family the full power to do whatever they want after my death.
        If they want something and someone else (who isn't a family member) does not, please obey my family.
        They probaly know best.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Cremation or burial?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Cremation. Your can flush my ashes in the toilet or place them somewhere nice, I don't care.</p>

        <p>The funny thing with cremations is that you still need a coffin.
        Please buy the cheapest one or build one yourself if you like that more.</p>

        <p>As for music, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tPcc1ftj8E" target="_blank">Seasons in the Sun of Terry Jacks</a> at the moment, it will probably change later.
        Don't take such a lyric personal or to litterly, I just the happiness in the sone, please remember the fun times and forget the bad ones ;-)</p>

        <p>In Holland they usually serve cake or something with coffee. Whatever floats your boat.
        But, please serve some special beers after or before the whole thing.
        You don't have to party if you don't want, but it is definetly not forbidden!</p>

        <p>I always liked to speech, so if someone wants to speech, feel free to do so. I can't wait to
        see the tears <em>(o wait, I'll be dead by then)</em>.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Digital life</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Because I'm kind of a digital person I have a lot online. I always make sure that someone can
        access my main emailaccount. For now that is my brother Harmen, he can takeover my email and
        turn of all services.</p>

        <p>If there is copyright on any of my work and nobody depends on the money coming out of it, please
        release it into the public.</p>

        <p>I'm fine with releasing all my personal data <em>(photos, emails, websites, writted texts, ...)</em>
        into the public as well. That would be cool, but it is also okay when people don't want their data to be shared. Privacy was always very important to me, so I will understand those people.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Belongings</h2>
      <section>
        <p>I probably won't have money when I'm dead. So be careful. The rest of my property is your business.
        If something is worth a lot, then you can also sell it and divide the money. As long as there is no
        fight about stuff, please. <em>But for now that would be silly, I only have an iMac and a Ducati Monster.</em></p>
