<h2>So will I, and here is my will</h2>

<section>
  <p>Is it strange to have a webpage on the internet with your wishes for after your death?
  I think so, but I know that it can be very handy if the people around you don't agree on the way
  your funeral should be or how your belongings should be distributed.</p>

  <p>I give {{page.girlfriend}} and my family full power to do whatever they want after my death <em>(except for my donorship)</em>.
  If my family wants something one way and someone else (who isn't a family member) wants it another, <strong>please obey my family</strong>.
  They probably know best.</p>
</section>

<h2>Cremation or burial?</h2>
<section>
  <p>Cremation. You can flush my ashes down the toilet or place them somewhere nice, I don't care.
  <strong>But</strong>, because the funeral would not be there for me but for the relatives,
  please do burial if people are offended by cremation.</p>

  <p>The funny thing with cremations is that you still need a coffin.
  Please buy the <strong>cheapest</strong> one or build one yourself if that helps with the process of grief.</p>

  <p>As for music, I like <a href="{{page.song_link}}" target="_blank">{{page.song_title}}</a> at the moment - it will probably change later. <a href="https://github.com/adriaanvanrossum/whenidie.adriaan.io">See history</a>.
  Don't interpret it too literally, I just like the happiness in this song. Please remember the fun times and laugh about the bad ones. :smiley:</p>

  <p>In Holland they usually serve cake or something with coffee. Whatever floats your boat.
  But, please serve <strong>special beers</strong> after or before the whole thing.
  You don't have to party if you don't want, but it is definitely not forbidden! :beers:</p>

  <p>Please, do not hold the ceremony in a church. I prefer to have one day with cremation and condolence together. If the family wants something else, that's okay.</p>

  <p>I always liked speeches, so if <strong>someone wants to give a speech</strong>, feel free to do so. I can't wait to
  see the tears :sob: <em>(o wait, I'll be dead by then)</em>!</p>

<h3>Card</h3>
<section>
  <p>I often see those black and white cards with a black border. Don't do this for me. Print me a white card and an orange border. Illustations are welcome.</p>
  <p>On the card, please link to <a href="https://whenidie.adriaan.io">this page</a> as well. Share the card on my social media channels with a little intro text.</p>
  <p>Don't mention any religion on the card.</p>
</section>

<h3>Dress code</h3>
<section>
  <p>I would love if you would wear the cloting of what you did wear on the last wedding you attended. If you don't feel comfortable with that, just wear something else.</p>
</section>

<h2>Digital life</h2>
<section>
  <p>Because I'm kind of a digital person I have a lot online. I always make sure that someone can
  access my password manager. For now that is <strong>{{page.girlfriend}}</strong>: she can takeover my accounts and
  turn off all the personal services. If she can't, ask my brothers Harmen and Anne. They might have ways to get in to my accounts.</p>

  <p>If there is copyright on any of my work and nobody depends on the money coming out of it, please
  release it as soon as possible into the public.</p>

  <p>I'm fine with releasing all my personal data <em>(photos, emails, websites, written texts, ...)</em>
  <strong>into the public</strong> as well. That would be cool, but it is also okay when people don't want their data to be shared. Privacy was always very important to me, so I understand! :eyes:</p>
</section>

<h2>Businesses</h2>
<section>
  <p>I am aware that this is maybe not a offical document, but it's my will. If it's not legal, so be it. My business is on my personal name and I would like to give it to my family (siblings and parents) and my girlfriend. 50/50. I think my brothers are maybe interested in running it and if not it can be sold.</p>
  <p>If you need access to my business you need to go to {{page.server_contact}} as he might be able to access the servers with data from my password manager.</p>
</section>

<h2>Belongings</h2>
<section>
  <p>I probably won't have money when I'm dead, so be careful. The rest of my property is your business.
  If something is worth a lot, then you can also sell it and divide up the money - as long as there is no
  fight about stuff. <em>Give my motorbike to somebody I know with a drivers license.</em></p>

  <p>As for my own body, <strong>I'm an organ donor</strong>. So please give my parts to people who can use it. This includes giving it away to science :hospital:</p>
</section>

<h2>Remembering</h2>
<section>
  <p>I would love if friends and family got together every year around my birthday and throw a (little) party together. This depends a bit on the age when I die, I guess. Birthday parties where always important to me. Where friends meet other friends and where everybody can drink and dance. If I can give something to my friends that are still on earth, it would be this.</p>

<p>Bye,<br />Adriaan</p>
