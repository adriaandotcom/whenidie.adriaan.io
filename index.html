<h2>So will I, and here is my will</h2>
<section>
  <p>Is it strange to have a webpage on the internet with your wishes for after your death?
  I think so, but I know that it can be very handy if the people around you don't agree on the way
  your funeral should be or how your belongings should be distributed.</p>

  <p>I give my family full power to do whatever they want after my death <em>(except for my donorship)</em>.
  If my family wants something one way and someone else (who isn't a family member) wants it another, <strong>please obey my family</strong>.
  They probably know best.</p>

<h2>Cremation or burial?</h2>
<section>
  <p>Cremation. You can flush my ashes down the toilet or place them somewhere nice, I don't care.</p>

  <p>The funny thing with cremations is that you still need a coffin.
  Please buy the <strong>cheapest</strong> one or build one yourself if you like that more.</p>

  <p>As for music, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tPcc1ftj8E" target="_blank">Seasons in the Sun by Terry Jacks</a> at the moment - it will probably change later.
  Don't interpret it too literally, I just like the happiness in the song. Please remember the fun times and forget the bad ones ;-)</p>

  <p>In Holland they usually serve cake or something with coffee. Whatever floats your boat.
  But, please serve some <strong>special beers</strong> after or before the whole thing.
  You don't have to party if you don't want, but it is definitely not forbidden!</p>

  <p>I always liked speeches, so if <strong>someone wants to give a speech</strong>, feel free to do so. I can't wait to
  see the tears <em>(o wait, I'll be dead by then)</em>!</p>

<h2>Digital life</h2>
<section>
  <p>Because I'm kind of a digital person I have a lot online. I always make sure that someone can
  access my main email account. For now that is <strong>my brother Harmen</strong>: can takeover my email and
  turn off all services.</p>

  <p>If there is copyright on any of my work and nobody depends on the money coming out of it, please
  release it into the public.</p>

  <p>I'm fine with releasing all my personal data <em>(photos, emails, websites, written texts, ...)</em>
  <strong>into the public</strong> as well. That would be cool, but it is also okay when people don't want their data to be shared. Privacy was always very important to me, so I understand!</p>
</section>

<h2>Belongings</h2>
<section>
  <p>I probably won't have money when I'm dead, so be careful. The rest of my property is your business.
  If something is worth a lot, then you can also sell it and divide up the money - as long as there is no
  fight about stuff. <em>But for now that would be silly, I only have an iMac and a Ducati Monster.</em></p>

  <p>As for my own body, <strong>I'm an organ donor</strong>. So please give my parts to people who can use it.</p>
